# Documentation of the **WebApi** project

## Purpose
The purpose of this example is to demonstrate
how a web API can be developed.

It is not fully functional example, as in case of MVC application, 
and it contains only controller for cities manipulation.

It has methods that coresponds to HTTP 
GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods/verbs.

Additionally, a wrapper for jTable has been developed, because jTable only used POST methods,
and expect that results is always 200, which was one of the motivations to demostrate exception filters.
